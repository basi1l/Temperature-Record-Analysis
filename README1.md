Step1: Task Overview
# Temperature Record Analysis
This project analyzes historical temperature records near Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, for the years 2005-2015. The analysis identifies record-breaking temperature highs and lows in 2015 compared to the previous decade. The code includes data manipulation, visualization, and mapping of weather station locations.

Step2: How to Run the Code
In this section, provide a step-by-step guide on how users can run the code. Since your project includes Python and specific libraries, explain how to set up the environment.
## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/basi1l/Temperature-Record-Analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd Temperature-Record-Analysis
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, and install the required libraries using:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, list the libraries used and their installation commands.

Run the code, e.g., by opening the Jupyter notebook (Temp_Record_Analysis.ipynb) and executing the cells.


jupyter notebook Temp_Record_Analysis.ipynb
Alternatively, run the script directly if available:

python script_name.py

Step 3: Special Libraries Used
In this section, list the special libraries required to run the project and their purpose. For example:
## Special Libraries Used

- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **geopandas**: For handling geographic data.
- **contextily**: To add map tiles in geographic visualizations.
